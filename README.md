project2.R is the file with the actual code for both the ui and the server. 
analysisForProject2.R is the file with the preprocessing that i used. It runs for quite a while, 
and often R studio would complain about it, so I ran it in two parts.
WordCloud_summary.png, Wordcloud_good.png, Wordcloud_bad.png, are images generated by wordcloud used 
in the app. 
Finally, employee_review.csv is the original data, and proj2_preprocessed data is the data after my preprocessing.
